In preparing the Vocabulary, care has been tehen to render
it as concise as possible, and yet to omit nothing of essentia]
importante to the student while perusing the Exercises aad
Reading Lessons.

To prevent, as far aa was practicable, the erroneoua habits
ol' pronunciation which students so osten acquire in the oom-
mencement of their Latin course, the inflected words in this,
aa in the larger Grammar, are divided into syllables, and the
place of the accent carefully marked. If the instructor will
sea that no error occurs in pronouncing the paradigma, and
that the subsequent lessons are first studied with reference to
pronunciation ¹alone, according to the rules of Orthiicpy on
the ninth aad tenth pagos, he will aava himself aad his pupils

much labor at a subsequent period, in attempting to correct ,

bad habits aster they have become nearly inveterate.

J uvenile classes, commcncing with this volume, and con·
tinuing to review it until familiar with every part, will be well
qualified to enter upon the study of the Reader in connection

with the larger Grammar. lt will be found a usesul exercise ³

forali classes, and especially for the younger ones, to prepara ¹
accurate, written translations of their Latin lessons, and on a
subsequent day to retranslate them into Latin without refer·

encetotheoriginal. Eaercises of this kind should atlirstbe ι

short, but may be gradually extended to almost any required

length By this means English words and phrases may hc ’

made to suggest to the student the corresponding Latin ones,
in the spine manner that the Latin usually suggesta the
proper English expression.
