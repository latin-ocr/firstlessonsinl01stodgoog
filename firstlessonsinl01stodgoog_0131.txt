ANALYSIS.

This sentence consists of sour propositione. 1. Tha*
me misdret, I pity you. 2. Aiebat testudini lacerta,
said a lizard to atortoise. 3. Quae roam, ipsa tecum
lttttttttltttathlttttll¹{htttltt
soever it plesse· (you) to go.

These propositions are to be analyzed and parsed

like the preceding; but in the first, the subject is want· ,

ing, and in the fourth, it consiste of the infinitive ceddre.
The impersonal verb misdret is here translated in such
a'manner that the pronoun me, depending upon it, ap·

pears in English as its subject, instead os the pronoun ’

it. It might, though less properly, have been trans·
lated, “ it pities.” Tho other impersonal verbs men·
tioned in 401 are usually translated in the same manner.
